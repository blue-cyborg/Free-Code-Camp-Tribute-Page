        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Alan Turing's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London, England, on June
            23, 1912
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1928</strong> - Developed math and science skills as a
            teenager. Turing was 16 years old in 1928 and could understand
            Albert Einstein's work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1930</strong> - Turing's first love, Christopher Collan
            Morcom (13 July 1911 - 13 February 1930),died in February 1930, from
            complications of bovine tuberculosis. Morcom contracted bovine
            tuberculosis drinking infected cow's milk. Turing and Morcom both
            loved math and science. After Morcom's death Turing worked even
            harder on math and science studies working through grief.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1931-1934</strong> - Turing pursues undergraduate studies at
            Kings College, Cambridge. Upon graduation, Turing recieved
            first-class honours in Mathematics
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1935</strong> - At age 22 Turing was elected a Fellow of
            King's College on the strength of his dissertation. The dissertation
            proved a version of the central limit theorem.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1936</strong> - Turing published his paper "On Computable
            Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem." It is one
            of the most influental math papers. Turing proposed and proved that
            his "universal computing machine" would be capable of performing any
            conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an
            algorithm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1936 -1938</strong> - Studied at Princeton University and
            got his PhD. Turing studied math and cryptology. His dissertation
            was "Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals." The work proposed the
            concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, in
            which Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing
            the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1938</strong> - Turing worked part-time with the Government
            Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking
            organisation. Turing concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma
            cipher machine used by Nazi Germany. Turing worked with Dilly Knox
            who was a senior codebreaker at GC&CS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1939 July</strong> - Polish Cipher Bureau gave the British
            and French details of the wiring of Enigma machine's rotors and
            their method of decrypting Enigma machine's messages, Turing and
            Knox developed a broader solution. uring and Knox developed a
            broader solution.The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator
            procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they in fact
            did in May 1940. Turing's approach was more general, using
            crib-based decryption for which he produced the functional
            specification of the bombe (an improvement on the Polish Bomba).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1939 September</strong> - The UK declares war on Germany.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1939 - 1945 </strong> - Turing works at Bletchley Park, the
            wartime station of GC&CS. Turing works on cracking German
            ciphertext. The Numberphile made an awesome easy two follow videos
            about cracking the German Enigma cipher machine. Check those out.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1945 - 1947</strong> - Turing worked on the design of the
            ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory
            (NPL)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1948</strong> - Turing worked on coding a computer chess
            program for a theoretical computer.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1950</strong> - Turing proposed the Turing Test in
            "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". The paper asks if computers
            can think. The Turing Test asks if humans thinks an interaction with
            a computer is another human. If a person mistakes an interaction
            with a computer as an interaction with a human then the computer
            passes the Turing Test.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1951</strong> - Turing gets interested in patterns in
            mathematical biology.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1952</strong> - Turing published "The Chemical Basis of
            Morphogenesis". It is a paper about patterns in nature that arise
            naturally from a homogeneous, uniform state.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1952</strong> - Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual
            acts in the UK. Turing could either go to prison or accept hormone
            treatments. These treatments were chemical castration. Turing opted
            for treatment instead of prison.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1954</strong> - Turing died from cyanide poisoning. An
            inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted
            that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental
            poisoning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2009</strong> - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an
            official public apology on behalf of the British government for "the
            appalling way [Turing] was treated".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2013</strong> - Queen Elizabeth II granted a posthumous
            pardon in 2013.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2017</strong> - The term "Alan Turing law" is now used
            informally to refer to a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that
            retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical
            legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>June 23 2021</strong> - Alan Turing is put on a Bank of
            England Â£50 note.
